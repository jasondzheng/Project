!! consider changing combat system to auto locking onto enemies (player dashes 
to nearest enemy) and enemies die from combos (in a row hits) or having completed all notes in a certain section instead of normal hp. Songs will be short bursts of same length sequences. Maybe have it like genji dash resets. 

Maybe have units attack even if not in range to show them attacking to the beat
